A "Todo App" written in React provides a convenient way to manage your tasks. In the app, you can:

1. Add tasks: Create a new task by entering its name and pressing Enter. New tasks are automatically added to the list.

2. Delete tasks: When a task is completed or no longer needed, you can remove it from the list by clicking the delete button.

3. Mark tasks as completed: You can mark tasks that you've already completed to easily track your achievements. Tasks with a "completed" status will be labeled accordingly.

4. Store tasks in local storage: All your tasks are saved in the browser's local storage. This allows you to revisit your tasks at any time without the need for creating accounts or connecting to a server.

The "Todo App" provides a convenient and straightforward way to manage your tasks and helps you stay organized and productive.
